Work in partners to make a virtual world or roleplaying game.
  
You can use my starter code if you want a full screen text experience, or you
can not and just scrap everything and start from scratch.

Each is worth one letter grade:

1) Track player location, health, and gold, and display them.

2) 5 puzzles that the player must solve to win, using 5 functions. The game
must be winnable.

3) There must be some sort of "combat", with something resembling health and
levels (i.e. the player must grow stronger over time). It must roll random
numbers for combat.

4) Dialogue - the player must have 20 or more lines of spoken dialogue in the
virtual world. AI controlled players (NPCs) must have 20 or more lines of
spoken dialogue. These lines should all be different, not copy-pasted. These
lines should all be different, not copy-pasted.

5) Worldbuilding - You must have 40+ sentences of description in your world.
You must do this even if you build your project in Unity or Unreal Engine, and
not text-based on the server.

6) Extra Credit - Do one or more of the following: A) An inventory system, B)
Have some music that you composed yourself or cover art for your game,
C) Shopkeepers or something to spend money on

If you are interested in more advanced coding, I have included source code for
a scrollable world map. Type "make" to build the project instead of "compile".
