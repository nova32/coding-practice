A pedometer treats walking 2,000 steps as walking 1 mile. 
Write a program whose input is the number of steps, and whose output is the miles walked.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved by executing
cout << fixed << setprecision(2); once before all other cout statements.

Ex: If the input is:
5345

the output is:
2.67

Your program must define and call a function:
double StepsToMiles(int userSteps)

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>
using namespace std;

/* Define your function here */ 

int main() {
   /* Type your code here */

   return 0;
}







Define stubs for the functions called by the below main().
Each stub should print "FIXME: Finish FunctionName()" followed by a newline, and should return -1. Example output: 

FIXME: Finish GetUserNum()
FIXME: Finish GetUserNum()
FIXME: Finish ComputeAvg()
Avg: -1


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

/* Your solution goes here  */

int main() {
   int userNum1;
   int userNum2;
   int avgResult;

   userNum1 = GetUserNum();
   userNum2 = GetUserNum();

   avgResult = ComputeAvg(userNum1, userNum2);

   cout << "Avg: " << avgResult << endl;

   return 0;
}

LAB:
One lap around a standard high-school running track is exactly 0.25 miles. 
Write a program that takes a number of miles as input, and outputs the number of laps.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved by executing
cout << fixed << setprecision(2); once before all other cout statements.

Ex: If the input is:
1.5

the output is:
6.00

Ex: If the input is:
2.2

the output is:
8.80

Your program must define and call a function:
double MilesToLaps(double userMiles)

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>                 // For setprecision
using namespace std;

/* Define your function here */ 

int main() {
   /* Type your code here. Your code must call the function.  */

   return 0;
}

The Pythagorean theorem is a formula that is used to solve the different sides of a right angle triangle. Here is an example of such a triangle:

Right angle triangle

If you know the value of two of the sides you can solve for the third using one of the following equations

 c\:=\:\sqrt{a^2+\:b^2}c = a 2 + b 2

a\:=\:\sqrt{c^2-b^2}a = c 2 − b 2

b = \sqrt{c^{2} - a^{2}  } b = c 2 − a 2

 

Your task is to create a function that will solve for any side given two known sides.

Specifics:

Your function should take three parameters: a double for the first side, a double for the second side, and a character to indicate the side to solve for. Your function should return a double value which holds the solved side.

For example:

double a = 4.0, b = 2.0, c;

c = pythag(a, b, 'c');

Notice the last parameter is a character which indicates the side to solve for.  Suppose you want to solve for side a:

double a, b = 4.0, c = 2.0;

a = pythag(b, c, 'a');

Required:

You must use the sqrt and pow functions to solve for the given side.
